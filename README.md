# Penumbra-D3D11

**Penumbra-D3D11** it's a *DirectX 11* renderer/game engine and my first approach/try into the Direct3D API.
This project is meant to be a 3D FPS-based Game Engine written in C++17.


## Disclaimer

This project is meant to be a 3D FPS-based Game Engine, not a general purpose game engine like *Unity Engine*, *Unreal Engine* or *Godot Engine*.

I have to change a lot of things on the current repository, add definitions and some core system features before work on the *sugar* which it's the D3D11 rendering stuff. I have to define the API, naming conventions and namespaces.

At the moment of writing this *(2024/12/25)*, there's not almost any feature to display. I can only name possible features and ideas if I got asked about this engine, but there's not much more yet.

**Soon it will pass a big change to match this ideal**


## Build and Run

The project is intended to be used on any Windows OS that supports DirectX 11, **There's not any support to build on platforms out of Windows.**

The only requirements to be able to build is have `Visual Studio 2022`, you download the repository project, open the `Penumbra-D3D11.sln` and hit `F5`.
